## Usage example

When you, Nulover, wants to use your funds from your account to buy incredible things from Nubank's shop

## Development setup

### Flutter Environment

### Installation

If you want to use Android Studio, then [download](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=es) it through the website;

Else, you can just use Visual Code or any other IDE that supports Android development with Flutter;

#### If you downloaded Android Studio:

Install it into your machine;

Go to File>Settings>Go to Pluggins and search and download Flutter, or if your Android Studio came with it, you do not need to do anything;

Configure the Environment Variables needed at your machine, and download JAVA for the emulator (if using);

Run flutter pub get on CMD to get all dependencies. You can also use flutter pub upgrade with this command.

#### Else:

Download the project;

Create a file called APICallConstant.dart under constants.api folder (you can just use the APICallConstantExample for that matter).

Run the commands flutter pub get and flutter pub upgrade and you're ready to modify the app.
